CJ's Description Here

## Explanation

Spectr's Customization module is a bit different than most, unlike other modules Customization doesn't have any commands related to it. Customization is a section of the `/config` command that allow you to set your server's very own Hex Code (Color), Emoji, and Embed Footer. This will set those aspects across all of Spectr's modules. For example, the Infraction module will now have a emoji, and embed footer so make Spectr feel more customizable to you and your server.
