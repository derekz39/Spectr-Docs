How Spectr governs your use of the service.

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Spectr! Please carefully review these Terms of Service ("Terms," "ToS") before accessing or using Spectr's services ("Spectr," "we," "our"). These services include the Spectr Discord bot ("bot"), our premium offerings, and any other affiliated tools or integrations provided by Spectr. By accessing or using Spectr's services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Spectr's services are based out of Florida with data centers out of state.



It is your responsibility to comply with any applicable local laws. These Terms apply to all users of Spectr's services. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, you are prohibited from using our services. We may modify these Terms at any time without notice. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 2. Access to the Service
Spectr reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to its services at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. If suspended or terminated, you may not attempt to access the service through any alternate means.

All sales, including Spectr Premium purchases, are final. We do not offer refunds under any circumstances, including service termination or bot discontinuation.

By using Spectr, you agree to:

Be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required by Discord's Terms of Service.
Refrain from using Spectr for any unlawful purposes.
Avoid impersonating Spectr or its team.
Abstain from exploiting or attempting to harm the service in any way.

## 3. Payments

## 4. Data Collection
Spectr collects and stores data necessary for functionality and operational purposes. This data includes but is not limited to:

Usernames, Discord IDs, and server IDs.
Settings or preferences configured via the bot (e.g., command configurations).
Data is stored securely using Mongoose and hosted on Galaxy Gate servers. Access to Spectr via the “Authorized Apps” setting of your Discord account can be revoked at any time.

To request the deletion of your data, you may contact us (see Contact Information below). Note: Certain data, such as infraction logs, cannot be deleted solely at user request as it is retained for operational and legal purposes.

By using Spectr's services, you agree not to:

Violate any applicable law or regulation.
Spread misinformation about Spectr or its team.
Use automated tools or scripts to exploit the service.
Reverse engineer or tamper with the service.
Spectr reserves the right to restrict access to the service for violations of these terms and report users to appropriate authorities as needed.

## 6. External Resources and Integrations
Spectr may interact with third-party services such as Discord and Stripe. We are not liable for the functionality, content, or availability of these external platforms.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
Spectr is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted, secure, or error-free service. Spectr is not liable for:

Loss of data or profits.
Service outages or interruptions.
Unauthorized access to your data.
We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time, with or without notice.

## 8. Dispute Resolution
