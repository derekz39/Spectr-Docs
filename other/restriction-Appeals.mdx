title: Restriction Appeals
---

At Spectr, we use a restriction system to ensure that all users have a fair and enjoyable experience. We understand that restrictions can be inconvenient, particularly for those who have paid for our services. This page provides a detailed overview of the restriction process, how to appeal, and answers to some frequently asked questions. If you need further assistance, you can always reach out to us at restrictions@spectrbot.app.

If your access to Spectr has been restricted, it may be due to a violation of either our [Terms Of Service](/terms-of-service) (ToS) or Discord's [Terms Of Service](https://discord.com/terms). We take these matters seriously to ensure a safe and fair environment for all users.

Effective Date: January 11th, 2024 (1/11/25)

## Common Reasons for Being Restricted
You may have been restricted due to violations such as:

- **Violation of Spectr’s ToS:** This includes actions like impersonating Spectr or its team, exploiting the service, or engaging in unlawful behavior.
- **Violation of Discord's ToS:** If your account breaks any rules set forth by Discord, it may lead to restrictions on Spectr.
- **Automated Tools or Scripts:** Using bots or scripts to manipulate Spectr’s functionality.
- **Spreading Misinformation:** Disseminating false or misleading information about Spectr or its team.

## Appeal Process
If you believe your exclusion was unfair or made in error, you can appeal by emailing us at restrictions@spectrbot.app. We review emails every few weeks, so please allow sufficient time for a response. Ensure your email includes the following information:

- The **Discord Username** and **User ID** of the account that was excluded from Spectr services.
- A **thorough explanation** outlining why you believe the exclusion was unfair or due to a misunderstanding.
- Any **evidence** that supports your claim.

## FAQs About Restrictions and Appeals
Do I get a refund if I purchased Spectr?
In most cases, no. When you purchased access to Spectr, you agreed to our [Terms Of Service](/terms-of-service), which includes the right to revoke access for any reason. Therefore, refunds are not provided in the event of a restriction. Please refrain from contacting us requesting a refund if you've been restricted.

All appeals are thoroughly discussed and reviewed by our Core Team & Management. In most cases, exclusions are only lifted if they were applied in error. We generally do not revoke exclusions based on promises like "I won’t do it again" or "It’s been X months."

### How long do exclusions last?
Exclusions are generally permanent; however, depending on the severity of the violation, some exclusions may be temporary. This is handled on a case-by-case basis.

### How do I know if my appeal was successful?
If your appeal is successful, we will respond to your original email, letting you know that the restriction has been lifted. If you do not hear back from us within 2–3 weeks, consider your appeal denied. Please note that pestering staff about your appeal status may lower the chances of a successful outcome.

### How do I report a user for an exclusion?
We accept community reports for users violating our [Terms Of Service](/terms-of-service). However, we do not handle reports related to specific community rules (e.g., inappropriate language). If you believe someone is violating our [Terms Of Service](/terms-of-service), please direct message our ModMail bot with your report.
