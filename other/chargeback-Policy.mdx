---
This policy details how we handle chargebacks and payment disputes (“dispute,” “disputes,” “chargeback,” “chargebacks”) for Spectr services. We highly recommend reaching out to us at billing@spectrbot.app before initiating a chargeback, as doing so may lead to restrictions (“service ban,” “block,” “suspension”) on accessing Spectr services.

Effective Date: January 11th, 2024 (1/11/25)

## 1. Chargeback Policy
If a chargeback is initiated for any payment made to Spectr, the following actions will be taken immediately:

The user's access to the slot or service associated with the payment will be revoked.
The user will be restricted from accessing any services provided by Spectr indefinitely.

## 2. Investigation Process
Upon receiving notice of a chargeback, we will:

Launch an investigation into the chargeback to understand the circumstances.
Attempt to contact the user directly to discuss the situation and gather more information.
## 3. Dispute Resolution
**Goal:** Our primary goal is to resolve the dispute in a fair and reasonable manner for all parties involved.

If the issue is resolved amicably and the payment dispute is settled, access to services may be restored at our discretion.

If we are unable to resolve the issue or reach an agreement, the user’s access to Spectr’s services will be permanently revoked.

## 4. Contact Information
If you have questions or concerns regarding a chargeback or payment dispute, please reach out to us at billing@spectrbot.app. Our team is here to assist and will work diligently to resolve any issues before a chargeback becomes necessary.

## 5. Commitment to Integrity
We take all chargebacks seriously. Fraudulent or unjustified chargebacks undermine the trust and fairness of our community. This policy is in place to ensure that Spectr remains a reliable and fair platform for all users.
